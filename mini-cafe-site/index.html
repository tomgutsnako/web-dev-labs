		<h3>Brewing Comfort, One Cup at a Time</h3>
		
	<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>Anntsy's Brew was born from a simple love for coffee and community. After years of sharing cups with friends and family, I realized how a good brew brings people together. Inspired by the warmth of my hometown and the joy of discovering new flavors, I decided to open a space where everyone can relax, connect, and enjoy quality coffee. Every cup we serve is a reflection of our passion and commitment to making your day a little brighter.</p>
